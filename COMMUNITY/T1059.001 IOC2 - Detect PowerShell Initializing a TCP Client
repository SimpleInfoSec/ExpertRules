## T1059.001 IOC2 - Detect PowerShell Initializing a TCP Client

## Author
https://github.com/SimpleInfoSec

## Description
This rule detects the use of PowerShell to create a TCP client using the System.Net.Sockets namespace and the TCPClient class. 
This may indicate the creation of a reverse shell using PowerShell. 

## Rule TCL
```tcl
Rule {
    Process {
        Include OBJECT_NAME { -v "*PowerShell*" }
        Include OBJECT_NAME { -v "*PWSH*" }
    }
    Target {
        Match PROCESS { 
            Include PROCESS_CMD_LINE { -v "*Net.Sockets.TCPClient*"}
        }
    }
}
```

## Trigger
You can trigger this rule by opening CMD and using PowerShell or PWSH to create a TCP Client. Make sure you use a test system and understand the command before executing it. 
Some examples of creating a reverse shell using PowerShell can be found here:

## Tested Platforms
Windows 10, ENS 10.7.x, PowerShell 5.1.17763.1490 & PWSH 7.2.0-preview.3

## Notes
There may be legitimate use cases for PowerShell creating TCP clients in your environment. I highly advise you to test this rule to determine it's practicality in your environment. 
PowerShell Reverse Shells are used by a variety of APT's. I recommend checking out T1059.001 in the MITRE ATT&CK matrix as well as reviewing other publicly released IOC's to view
code samples of PowerShell reverse shells.
